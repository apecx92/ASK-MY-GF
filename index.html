            <h2>Story Sikit</h2>
            <p>From the moment we started chatting on Bumble to meeting up, having dinner at Ketam, and enjoying countless other dinners together, it's been an amazing journey. Even though it's only been a little over a month, it feels like we've known each other much longer. We've had some misunderstandings and conflicts, but I believe these are part of getting to know each other better, and theyâ€™ll only make our bond stronger. I really enjoy spending time with you and would love to take this further.</p>
